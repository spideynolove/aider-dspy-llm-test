# Prompt list

## Dspy first start

How can I simplify the following introduction for middle schoolers, breaking it into multiple ideas and carefully explaining technical terms?

```
DSPy is the framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows you to iterate fast on building modular AI systems and offers algorithms for optimizing their prompts and weights, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.

DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write compositional Python code and use DSPy to teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs.
