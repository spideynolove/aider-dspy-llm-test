# 7 Next-Generation Prompt Engineering Techniques

With large language model (LLM) products such as ChatGPT and Gemini taking over the world, we need to adjust our skills to follow the trend. One skill we need in the modern era is **prompt engineering**.

Prompt engineering is the strategy of designing effective prompts that optimize the performance and output of LLMs. By structuring the input, prompt engineering aims to provide relevant and high-quality results.

There are many standard prompt engineering techniques, such as **zero-shot**, **few-shot**, and **chain-of-thought**, but this article will explore various advanced techniques that you might not have heard of previously.

With that in mind, let’s get into it.

## 1. Meta Prompting

Meta prompting is a prompt engineering technique that depends on certain LLMs to generate and refine prompts for other LLMs, including itself. It’s a method where we develop high-level prompts, and the prompt-refining LLM will produce much more specific and effective inputs for us.

The technique works by treating the prompt as the output itself. The main aspect of meta prompting is that it allows LLMs to generate prompts, interpret the prompt, and adapt the prompt output based on feedback. It’s a great technique that enables LLMs to self-reflect.

### Advantages:
- Automates the production of effective prompts.
- Adapts easily to complex tasks.
- Improves the quality of LLMs’ output.

### Challenges:
- Relies on the LLM’s inherent knowledge base.
- May not perform well on tasks where the LLM has little innate knowledge.

### Example:
**Initial Prompt:**
```
Generate a detailed prompt that can help a language model write a persuasive essay. The generated prompt should include instructions on structure, tone, and essential elements to be covered in the essay.
```

**Generated Meta Prompt:**
```
Write a persuasive essay arguing why renewable energy should replace fossil fuels as the primary energy source. Structure the essay as follows:
- Introduction: Start with a compelling hook and provide a clear thesis statement.
- Body Paragraph 1: Discuss environmental benefits, using evidence and examples.
- Body Paragraph 2: Address economic advantages, such as job creation and cost savings.
- Body Paragraph 3: Counter potential opposing arguments, such as feasibility or cost concerns, and refute them logically.
- Conclusion: Summarize key points and end with a powerful call to action. Use a confident and persuasive tone throughout.

## 2. Least-to-Most Prompting

Least-to-most prompting (LtM) is a technique that improves the LLM’s ability to handle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. The method allows LLMs to generate more accurate and comprehensive output by addressing the problem sequentially.

### Advantages:
- Ideal for complex problems.
- Guides the model to follow specific steps.

### Challenges:
- Requires a clear understanding of the problem.
- Errors in decomposition can lead to compounded mistakes.

### Example:
**Prompt:**
```
Question: How many unique words are in the sentence “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”? Let’s break down this problem:
1. Identify all the words in the sentence.
2. Determine which words are unique.
3. Count the number of unique words.
```

**Output:**
```
Answer: 8 unique words
```

## 3. Multi-Task Prompting

Multi-task prompting is a technique where one prompt is designed to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The prompt allows the LLM to handle interconnected actions within a single run.

### Advantages:
- Efficient output for related tasks.
- Maintains context across tasks.

### Challenges:
- Requires LLMs capable of handling higher complexity.
- More tasks can decrease output accuracy.

### Example:
**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the sentiment of the following customer review and summarize its main points: ‘I recently purchased the new smartphone model, and while I appreciate its sleek design, the battery life is disappointing, and the camera quality is subpar.’
```

**Output:**
```
Sentiment Analysis:
The sentiment of the review is mixed, leaning slightly negative. The reviewer acknowledges a positive aspect (sleek design) but expresses dissatisfaction with two critical features (battery life and camera quality).

Summary of Main Points:
- Positive: The design of the smartphone is sleek and appreciated.
- Negative:
  - The battery life is disappointing.
  - The camera quality does not meet expectations.
```

## 4. Role Prompting

Role prompting is a technique where the LLM is assigned a specific role or persona, such as a teacher, mechanic, or scientist, to guide its output.

### Advantages:
- Ensures domain-specific relevance.
- Useful for tailored responses.

### Challenges:
- May perpetuate stereotypes.
- Requires diverse training data for effective role emulation.

### Example:
**Prompt:**
```
As a historian, provide an overview of the causes and consequences of the Industrial Revolution.
```

**Output:**
```
The Industrial Revolution was a transformative period in history that began in the late 18th century, primarily in Britain, before spreading to other parts of the world. It marked the shift from agrarian and handcrafted economies to industrialized and mechanized systems of production.
```

## 5. Task-Specific Prompting

Task-specific prompting is a technique where the prompt is designed for a particular type of task, with specific instructions and context.

### Advantages:
- Precise and efficient output.
- Ideal for well-defined tasks.

### Challenges:
- Requires clear and detailed prompt crafting.

### Example:
**Prompt:**
```
Task: Code Debugging
Analyze the following Python code snippet and identify any bugs or inefficiencies.
Your analysis should:
1. Clearly describe what the code is intended to do.
2. Point out any issues or errors in the code, explaining why they occur.
3. Suggest solutions or improvements to fix the issues or optimize the code.
4. Provide a corrected or improved version of the code, if applicable.

Code:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        total += numbers[i]
    return total / len(numbers)
```

## 6. Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)

Program-aided language models (PAL) is a technique that integrates an external programming environment to solve tasks. The LLM translates the input into structured program steps, which are then executed by an external interpreter.

### Advantages:
- Useful for tasks requiring programming capabilities.
- Structured and accurate problem-solving.

### Challenges:
- Requires access to external programming tools.

### Example:
**Prompt:**
```
# Q: Sarah has $150 in her bank account. She deposits 200 more, and then she withdraws 50. How much money does she have now?
initial_balance = 150
deposit = 200
withdrawal = 50
answer = initial_balance + deposit - withdrawal
print(answer)
```

## 7. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting

Chain-of-verification (CoVe) is a technique designed to improve LLM accuracy by systematically verifying and refining the output. It addresses hallucination issues by verifying each claim made by the model.

### Steps:
1. The LLM produces initial answers.
2. The model generates specific questions to verify the accuracy of its answer.
3. The model answers the verification questions.
4. The model integrates the verification answers to refine the output.

### Example:
**Initial Output:**
```
Three famous inventions by Nikola Tesla are the Tesla Coil, AC (Alternating Current) system, and the radio.
```

**Verification Questions:**
```
- Was the Tesla Coil invented by Nikola Tesla?
- Did Nikola Tesla invent the AC system?
- Did Nikola Tesla invent the radio?
```

**Verification Answers:**
```
- Yes, the Tesla Coil was invented by Nikola Tesla in 1891.
- Nikola Tesla significantly contributed to the AC system, but he did not single-handedly invent it.
- Although Tesla made significant contributions to radio technology, the invention of the radio is primarily credited to Guglielmo Marconi.
```

**Refined Output:**
```
Three famous inventions by Nikola Tesla are the Tesla Coil, his contributions to the AC system, and advancements in radio technology (though the radio’s invention is credited to Guglielmo Marconi).
```
