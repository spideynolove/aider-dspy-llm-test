# Coding Conventions for Scrapy Projects

## General Guidelines

* Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
* Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for variables and functions)
* Keep code organized and modular

## Scrapy Specific

* Use Scrapy's built-in data structures (e.g., Item, Request) instead of custom ones
* Keep spider code separate from item pipeline code
* Use Scrapy's built-in logging mechanisms instead of print statements

## Best Practices

* Test your code regularly
* Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes
* Keep your code up-to-date with the latest Scrapy version

## Example Use Cases

* Updating Scrapy spider to use latest version of Scrapy
* Fixing Scrapy item pipeline to handle new data format
* Optimizing Scrapy project for performance
